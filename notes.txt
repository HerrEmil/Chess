Add possibility of en passant moves in moveGen
 - If pawn is in 5th rank, and en passant is true, and en passant pawn is next to pawn, it is a valid move

In switchTurn, handle en passant state


In make move, turn on possibility of en passant when making pawn move from 2nd to 4th rank
 - AI is not affected by stuff in really make move, only kinda make move, so kinda make move should be rule complete

En Passant Object
 - Contains position of pawn that is up for the taking
 -
